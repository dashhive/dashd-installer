[dashd-installer.sh](https://github.com/dashhive/dashd-installer.sh) |
[dash-insight-installer.sh](https://github.com/dashhive/dash-insight-installer.sh)

This script installs a dash full node on Debian based systems such as Ubuntu (i.e. on Digital Ocean) and Raspbian (i.e. on Raspberry Pi)

This installs the following components to `/opt/dashpay`:

* BerkleyDB
* libsodium
* ZeroMQ
* Dash Full Node [`dashpay/dash`](https://github.com/dashpay/dash)

Installation
-----

This is the no-hassle automatic installation.
If you're interested in the details of the process and want to learn
more either read the source or check out this article:
https://github.com/dashhive/dashd-installer.sh/blob/master/BLOG.md

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dashhive/dashd-installer.sh.git
pushd ./dashd-installer.sh/
bash install.sh
```

Everything for `dashd` installs to `/opt/dashpay`:

```
/opt/dashpay/bin/dashd
/opt/dashpay/docs
/opt/dashpay/etc
/opt/dashpay/include
/opt/dashpay/lib
/opt/dashpay/share
```

*Uninstall*:

```bash
rm -rf /opt/dashpay; userdel -r dash; groupdel dash; rm -f /etc/systemd/system/dashd.service
```

Configuration
--------

The configs can be edited at:

```
/opt/dashpay/etc/dash.conf
/etc/systemd/system/dashd.service
```

daemon control
--------

`dashd` can be restarted with `systemctl`:

```bash
systemctl restart dashd
```

You can see the logs with `journalctl`:

```bash
journalctl -xefu dashd
```

You can disable and enable `dashd` loading on startup:

```bash
systemctl enable dashd
systemctl disable dashd
```

Manual daemon control
-----------------

```
/opt/dashpay/bin/dashd -daemon -conf=/opt/dashpay/etc/dash.conf -datadir=/opt/dashpay/var
```

Setting rpc auth
--------

`/opt/dashpay/etc/dash.conf`:

```
rpcuser=dash
rpcpass=something random
```

Troubleshooting
=====

Raspberry Pi
------------

If you're running this on an ARM device there may be issues that cause the process to die several times.

It may be best to manually go through the steps in the install script and just rerun any compile step that fails.
Run it enough times and it will work eventually.

I know that sounds random and computers shouldn't be random, but I think there may be either a bug in GCC or,
perhaps more likely, a problem in the CPU or RAM on some of these ARM devices.

configure: error: libdb_cxx headers missin
------------------------

Problem:

```
./configure

...

checking for Berkeley DB C++ headers... no
configure: error: libdb_cxx headers missing, Dash Core requires this library for wallet functionality (--disable-wallet to disable wallet functionality)
```

Solution:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev -y --allow-unauthenticated
```

Or, if that fails:

```bash
wget http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz
tar -xzvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz
pushd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/
  ../dist/configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-cxx
  make -j4
  sudo make install

  sudo bash -c 'echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/db-4.8.30.conf'
  sudo ldconfig
popd
```

configure: error: No working boost sleep implementation found.
------

Problem:

```
./configure

...

checking for mismatched boost c++11 scoped enums... ok
configure: error: No working boost sleep implementation found.
```

Solution:

```
sudo apt install -y libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev
```

Error: Failed to load masternode cache
--------

Problem:

```
Error: Failed to load masternode cache from /opt/dashpay/var/mncache.dat
```

Solution:

You've probably run out of disk space.

```bash
# assuming -datadir=/opt/dashpay/var/
rm /opt/dashpay/var/debug.log
```

You'll need to delete the caches:

```bash
# rm /opt/dashpay/var/{banlist.dat,fee_estimates.dat,governance.dat,mncache.dat,mnpayments.dat,netfulfilled.dat,peers.dat}

pushd /opt/dashpay/var/
  rm banlist.dat
  rm fee_estimates.dat
  rm governance.dat
  rm mncache.dat
  rm mnpayments.dat
  rm netfulfilled.dat
  rm peers.dat
popd
```

Killed
------

Problem:

Starts and then dies with no explanation.

It may think it's still running... ?

Solution:

In at least one case all I had to do was delete the lock and pid files:

```
rm .lock dashd.pid
```

ZMQ connection delay
------

Problem:

```
[2017-12-12T11:39:04.523Z] warn: ZMQ connection delay: tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
```

```
netcat -v localhost 28332
# Connection refused
```

[Test](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/65066/68465):

You can know for sure that the

```
grep -r 'ENABLE_ZMQ' /opt/dashpay/src/dash/config.log
```

If you see `#define ENABLE_ZMQ 0` instead of `#define ENABLE_ZMQ 1`, then you definitely don't have ZMQ support compiled in.

Solution:

You should use `--prefix=/opt/dashpay` (or `--prefix=/opt/bitpay` or `--prefix=/usr/local` or whatever) when compiling libsodium, libzmq3, and then again
when compiling `bitcore`/`dashd` itself.

```bash
./configure --prefix=/opt/dashpay
```
